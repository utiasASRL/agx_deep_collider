/**
* \brief This class enables tracking and maintaining a list of 2D or 3D objects.
*
* A linear Kalman Filter is used to update an object track's position and velocity
* given an associated detection. This class also has methods for data association
* between tracks and detections as well as pruning duplicate tracks.
*
* A HiddenMarkovModel is used to filter the object states temporally.
*
* Note that we maintain a confidence level for each object track. This confidence is based primarily on the confidence
* output by the detector (possibly a DNN) and is smoothed temporally. The confidence decays exponentially when there are
* no observations. Object tracks should be ignored by the planner below a certain threshold. Objects that are unobserved
* for a long period (delete_time) are deleted permanently.
*
* Matrix Toc is the transformation from the sensor frame to the static world frame (odom). We use this to track objects
* in a static world frame. Setting this matrix to identity enables tracking within the sensor frame.

      detections and object tracks. Associations that result in a distance greater than metricGate are
      considered infeasible. The data association is performed in an optimal manner.
